# Project Context

## Goal
Build a Dockerized CLI to migrate flights from CloudAhoy to FlySto with minimal local dependencies. Long-term goal is a hosted SaaS offering with billing.

## Current Status
- CLI wiring and migration flow exist but API adapters are stubs.
- Docker image runs the CLI (`python -m src.cli`).
- Config uses env vars and `.env` via Docker `--env-file`.

## Required API Details
These are needed to complete the adapters:
- CloudAhoy: auth method, flight list endpoint, pagination, flight detail export format, rate limits.
- FlySto: auth method, flight upload endpoint, accepted payload formats (e.g., GPX/IGC/CSV/JSON), rate limits, dedupe keys.

## Assumptions (until docs arrive)
- Auth uses API keys in headers.
- Listing returns a unique flight id and timestamp.
- Upload accepts a single flight payload per request.

## State Tracking
- A local SQLite DB (default `data/migration.db`) tracks per-flight migration status to avoid duplicates.
- Successful migrations are skipped unless `--force` is provided.

## Next Steps
1) Implement CloudAhoy list + detail calls.
2) Implement FlySto upload.
3) Add mapping logic once payload shapes are known.
